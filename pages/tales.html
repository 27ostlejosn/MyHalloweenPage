            <h1>Haunted Tales</h1>

            <h2>Tale #1</h2>
            <p>On day there was this house and two kids saw the house and came into take a look and then they were walking upstairs and they kept hearing voices. Then, a hand grabbed then through the floor boards and pulled them down. They got up and got outside and when they did, they saw heads on the door. There was a guy with a chainsaw that ran at them, chopped there heads off, and ate there heads for breakfast.</p>
